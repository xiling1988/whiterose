This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
##Structure

This app handles the frontend and backend from the same folder. All sanity related libraries are found in the only package.json file.
Configuration is in sanity.config.js. 
When reusing/cloning this project, make sure to use your own sanity project ID and dataset by modifying your environment variables in the .env file. 

During development, Sanity Studio can be accessed running 
```bash
run npm run dev
```
and visiting http://localhost:3000/studio.


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
